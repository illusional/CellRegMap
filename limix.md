CellRegMap's linear mixed model (LMM) implementation uses the fastLMM fast implementation described [here]() and used in the [limix]() framework.

LIMIX is described in [this preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/003905v2) and documentation can be found [here]().

Additionally, for a limix wrapper specifically to map eQTL, see our [limix QTL pipeline]() which we used in our recent [Genome Biology Publication](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02407-x).
